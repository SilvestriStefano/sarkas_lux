A Pure Python Molecular Dynamics package for Non-Ideal Plasmas
##############################################################

Sarkas is a pure-Python Molecular Dynamics (MD) package designed with plasma physics in mind. The
pure-python construction allows users to quickly add their own features to model the systems of
their choosing. 

.. warning:: Sarkas is under development.

In the following pages you will find tutorials and information on the functionalities that have been tested and work correctly. If you want to collaborate and help us improve
