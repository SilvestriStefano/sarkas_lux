Potentials
==========

Sarkas aims to support a variety of potentials both built-in and user defined. Currently the potential functions that are implemented include

- Pairwise Yukawa

You can read more about each of these potentials in the corresponding sections below.

Yukawa Potential
----------------
The Yukawa potential is a widely used in the plasma community to describe the interactions of positively charged ions in a uniform background of electrons. The form of the Yukawa potential for two identical ions is given by


.. math::
   V(r) = \frac{Z_{\text{eff}}^2}{r}e^{-r/\lambda_e},

Where :math:`r` is the distance between ions, :math:`Z_{\text{eff}}` is the effective ion charge or the effective ionization, and :math:`\lambda_e` is the electron screening length.
