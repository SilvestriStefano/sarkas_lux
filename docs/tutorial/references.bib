	abstract = {In the collective mode spectrum of a relativistic, strongly coupled plasma, novel physical effects emerge, which are absent both in the weakly coupled relativistic and in the strongly coupled non-relativistic plasmas. Inspired by the pseudo-relativistic behavior of the electron gas in two-dimensional graphene layers, we address the problem of a classical two-dimensional, ultrarelativistic system of charged particles. We investigate the mode dispersion and damping both through molecular dynamics simulations and analytically via the quasi-localized charge approximation and develop modiﬁcations of the theory appropriate for this system. The new aspect introduced in the simulation is the decoupling of particle velocities from the particle momenta. As for new physical features, their origin is to be sought in the constancy of particle speeds and in the broad distribution of ‘plasma frequencies’, mimicking the similar distribution of momenta is causing the system to emulate the behavior of a collection of an inﬁnite number of oscillators. Of particular interest is the strongly reduced damping at weak coupling, brought about by the disappearance of the Landau damping and the greatly enhanced damping at strong coupling, caused by the phase mixing of the coupled plasma oscillators. We suggest the possible experimental detection of these effects in graphene.},
